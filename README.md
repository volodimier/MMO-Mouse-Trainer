## Overview

MMO gaming mice like the Razer Naga, Logitech G600, and Corsair Scimitar feature 12 programmable buttons on the side, designed to be pressed with your thumb. While these buttons provide quick access to game actions, it can be challenging to accurately press the right button without looking, especially during intense gameplay.

This trainer helps you build the muscle memory needed to confidently use all 12 buttons without hesitation.

Should works with all modern browsers.
